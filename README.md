## 711 5th Avenue Wordpress Theme

Custom WP theme for 711 5th Avenue, NY.

Result of 10hrs of work, roughly 50-50 for front-end and back-end.
Developed using SASS 7-1 pattern, automated workflow with gulp.js and ACF Pro.

To edit, clone this repo, in the root folder of the theme (711) run `npm install` and then `gulp` to watch and compile SCSS and JS changes automatically.

DB available upon request. :)

Left to do:

* ~~Mobile nav~~
* ~~Parallax animations~~
* ~~Text/content lazy loading~~
* ~~General code tidy up~~
